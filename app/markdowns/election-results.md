Get UK Parliament election results for every general election since 2010 and every by-election since the 2015 general election. Results include the number of constituencies contested and won, and the number of votes and vote share, for every party that stood a candidate in each election. 

 

There are also dedicated tables for members, parties and constituencies. These allow you to view the candidacies of former and current MPs, compare each party's historical performance at general elections and by-elections, and view any constituency’s results at each election.
