Find property transactions through HM Land Registry by searching on address, type of property or a price or date range. Property types include terraced, detached, semi-detached, flat or maisonette, and other. You can filter properties based on freehold or leasehold, and new build or not new build.

You can also search the UK house price index to find house price trends in the UK, or download quarterly house price data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
