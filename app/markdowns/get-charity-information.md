Find information about registered charities in England and Wales. Search the Charity Commission register by charity name, charity number, area, activities and classifications. 

Results include details of the charity’s income and expenditure, how it spends its money, the number of employees, trustees and volunteers, and a breakdown of employees with total benefits over £60,000. You can download a dataset of the entire register, view lists of the top 10 charities in different categories, and view a graphical representation of data about the charity sector data. You can also retrieve information via API – the data returned is live and in real-time.
