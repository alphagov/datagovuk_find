Use the election information API to provide users with all the information they need to take part in elections. The API uses postcode lookup to tell voters where and when to vote, and the candidates standing for elections in their area. The API shows dates for every type of election – from by-elections to general elections – and tracks if an election has been cancelled. Town, parish and community council elections, and referendums, are not included.
