    About data.gov.uk
  </h1>

  <p>Since 2010 data.gov.uk has been helping people to find and use open government data, and supporting government publishers to maintain data. It’s the best place to freely publish and find government data.</p>

  <p>The site is maintained by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital Service (GDS)</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">What’s on data.gov.uk</h3>

  <p>You can find:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>data published by central government, local authorities and public bodies</li>
    <li>links to download data files</li>
    <li>help on creating an account to publish data</li>
   </ul>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">How data.gov.uk and policy work together</h3>

  <p>Better data can help inform better policy-making and continuous improvement of services. Departments can combat fraud and reduce waste.</p>

  <p>By taking ethical, open, innovative and transparent approaches to data we can build greater levels of trust with citizens, whilst delivering more cost-effective and better targeted and tailored services to their needs.</p>

  <p>Data is at the heart of digital transformation and a part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy-better-use-of-data">Government Transformation Strategy</a>.</p>

  <p>GDS works with other organisations both within and outside government on shaping the strategic direction on how data is managed, accessed and used. We work collaboratively on a range of issues with the Office for National Statistics, Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and The National Cyber Security Centre.</p>
